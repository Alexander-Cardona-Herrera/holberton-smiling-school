# 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap

-   By Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer and Guillaume Salva, CTO at Holberton School

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.
